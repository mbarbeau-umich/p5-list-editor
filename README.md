## Project Goal (found on the EECS 280 website):
The learning goals of this project include Container ADTs, Dynamic Memory, The Big Three, Linked Lists, and Iterators. You will gain experience with new and delete, constructors and destructors, and the List data structure that is similar to std::list from the standard library.

When you’re done, you’ll have implemented the basic features of a text editor that is usable through a terminal-based visual editor, similar to other terminal editors such as Pico, nano, Emacs, and vi.
